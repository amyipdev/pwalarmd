## Installation

### Distro Packages

We don't have any distro packages yet. If you'd like
native distribution packages, help contribute!

### Manual Installation

#### Option 1: Crates.io

Install using `cargo`:

```sh
cargo install pwalarmd
cargo install pwalarmctl
```

#### Option 2: GitHub

Clone the repository:

``` sh
git clone https://github.com/amyipdev/pwalarmd.git
```

Enter and run the apps as needed:

``` sh
cd pwalarmd
# For pwalarmd
cargo run
# For pwalarmctl
cd pwalarmctl
cargo run -- <options>
```

Or, install to the system (not tested):

``` sh
cd pwalarmd
cargo install --path .
cd pwalarmctl
cargo install --path .
```

#### Post-Installation

You will need to configure your pwalarmd; this
includes providing sound assets.

## Configuration

You can set a custom config path by setting the
environment variable `PWALARMD_CONFIG` to the path.
All paths should be  **absolute** to avoid issues
with daemonization. Otherwise, `pwalarmd` first
looks for `~/.config/pwalarmd/pwalarmd.toml`,
then `/etc/pwalarmd.toml`.

If you're trying to troubleshoot or debug, set
`PWALARMD_NODAEMON=0` as an environment variable or
set `daemon = false` in your config.

## Usage

Run `pwalarmd` to launch the daemon.

Run `pwalarmctl` to control it, or modify the
config file currently being used. For help with
`pwalarmctl`, run `pwalarmctl help`.

To remove an alarm, run `pwalarmctl list`, and note
the 8 characters on the left of the alarm you want
to remove; you can then run `pwalarmctl remove N`,
where N are those characters, to remove the alarm.

## Contributing

## Limitations and Known Issues

`pwalarmd` may crash under malformed packets. 
Work is being done to prevent this from happening.

## Licensing and Credits

and `pwalarmctl/Cargo.toml`.

## Motivation

Windows, macOS, iOS, and Android all have usable
alarm subsystems. No such thing exists on most Linux
distros. There generally aren't any CLI-based ones,
with them all being GUI apps; they also often 
require that said GUI app be constantly open, 
which doesn't meet a lot of use cases.
